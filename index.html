                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, solid long rush and good moving as a pack, when everyone is looking at one spot like short you must try to realize where you are open from, in this situation no-one realized the enemy flanking long which nearly won a 1v4 situation. W</li>
                    <li>Galil buy, Good cover and solid trade for your teammates killing the guy lowers,Bad flash blinding teammates and yourself as you came out B, also crosshair placement was a bit off as you were moving around on the B site overall solid round. W</li>
                    <li>Galil buy, when playing a 3v1 situation you should really try to get all your teammates to come with you wherever you go as the only way the enemy can win is by catching you guys 1 by 1, also when you have the bomb always play super far back short so even if the CT enemy kills you there is no chance of the bomb dropping CT. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good flashes long to get a flash assist kill, and solid reaction to the enemy pushing up middle a very quick kill, also good trade and solid kill on the enemy on site. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good flashes long again and solid flash assist, again when everyone is focused on the 1 angle it is your job to cover the potential flank which is long again which nearly wins them this 2v4 situation. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, I don’t recommend this random jumping as even though you are gaining information it takes 1.5 seconds for you to be accurate again after landing from a jump and this puts you at a significant disadvantage in any gun-fight you take, unfortunately, tried to cross CT with no CT smoke even though you had a smoke on your body. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good b smoke doors to allow your teammates to focus on just the enemies on sight, when blind you should focus getting to cover or hiding in this situation you were caught out in the open from the awper peeking window. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Unfortunately, got caught off-guard from the enemy rushing long, as your spray was tracking behind the enemy, I recommend listening for a long run and always being ready if they are on a low buy like they were. L</li>
                    <li>p250 no armour, unfortunate timing on looking away from lower tunnels. L</li>
                    <li>Deag armour, a good trade kill on the guy lowers, unfortunately, you were not expecting the push-uppers at the same time so you got caught off-guard. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good readiness for the guy pushing middle, but again you need to focus on holding the angles your teammates are not as this is the third time the enemy has flanked long and gotten a free kill nearly 2. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good focus on killing the guy long but it was a disadvantageous fight as you were facing off against an awp, I would have recommended sitting car instead of openly on Ramp as this would have given you cover from long and CT so you would have put yourself at a bit more of an advantage. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Solid hold against the enemy pushing lowers for an easy kill, good utility on B with the door smoke and a nice flash coming out tunnels, also a solid trade on your teammate killing the guy on site as well as getting the bomb down, solid overall round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good pathing onto B but you should have focused on getting the smoke down sooner as the awper by door and scout by window was causing alot of issues for your teammates exiting tunnels. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Unfortunately, you got caught off-guard by the enemy pushing middle although they have done this quite a few times in the past just unfortunate timing as you pulled out your knife. W</li>
                    <li>CT pistol, pistol armour, Nice spam through the smoke to get the kill on the enemy lowers. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, When crossing I don’t recommend jumping as this actually makes it easier for the enemy to get the kill/damage on you, while spraying you stepped but fortunately your spray hit his head which was nice. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, positioning when holding tunnels is extremely open with no cover just kind of standing out in the open, unfortunately, you left B as your thought the enemy was short even though your teammate had already killed the one short player and the enemy pushed out onto B. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Solid double kill although going up elevator was executed poorly as you had many opportunities to die, I will show you the optimal pathing, although good job not dying to the enemy on site and getting the kill on the one long as well as the last enemy hiding on site. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good B positioning and solid B utility, although unfortunate movement caused you to die. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you during that game, positions you wanted/comfortable in real life/engagements you took? <br>Bit uncomfortable, pressured from streaming to coaching, felt unimpactful during the game, T side felt particularly bad, CT side a bit better </li>
                    <li>How did your crosshair placement feel? <br>Wasn’t really thinking about it</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel? <br>So overall not very focused on how muscle memory felt</li>
                    <li>How did your overall aim mechanics feel, like spraying, flicking, preaiming ect? <br>Bad spray down long</li>
                    <li>How did your movement feel? <br>Didn’t counter-strafe, and overall movement felt quite bad</li>
                    <li>How did your positioning feel? <br>The positions chosen could definitely be improved apon.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br>Utility felt pretty although</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game, and were you calling the correct positions and giving the correct information? <br>Calling out what you could but wern't specific</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br>Yea you enjoyed the players</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing could you immediately improve on for the next game you play?<br>Crouch less during gun-fights</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Focus areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crouch less and only use it when necessary such as movement or when it gives you an advantage in an angle.</li>
                    <li>Focus on holding angles your teammates are not to prevent any chance of flanks</li>
                    <li>Don’t randomly jump OR pull out utility when there is a possibility of you getting shot or seeing an enemy</li>
                    <li>Focus on improving crosshair placement</li>
                    <li>Focus on improving Rifle spray control</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What we went over</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Counter-Strafing</li>

                <h3>FFA DM:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shooting before crosshair is on the enemy somtimes is okay but you were doing it quite consistently I want you to follow this: <br> -Stop (properly counter-strafe) <br> -Flick(Move your crosshair onto the head of the enemy as quickly as you can) <br> -Shoot (Only shoot once your crosshair is on your enemy and then proceed with proper spray control until either you kill them or you die, do not jiggle or move after you have started shooting) <br> Note (Keep spray at head level and try to avg %85 HS kills)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Match notes Dust2</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, dangerous peeks maybe should have waited for teammate to get closer so he could trade quicker. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, good first kill and solid use of smoke and flash, although after the enemy platform knew your position and you had reloaded I would have recommended peeking him as he was able to prefire you after he reloaded killing you before you could react. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, again good positioning slight miss with the flash landing platform but it still worked, unfortunately your teammate was blocking you but you did a good job staying alive and playing around B site pillar. W</li>
                    <li>Galil buy, good tuns smoke and solid rotation and good listening to get the kill on the enemy short, and good reaction to get the second kill, unfortunately the rotate to B was a bit slow and predicatble allowing the enemy to play outside B and wait for you to come out tunnels. L</li>
                    <li>AWP buy, good rotate B, although you did not use any utility to retake instead just peeking all the angle which could be a dangerous play but it did almost land you 2 kills, good first kill. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, Fantastic long hold almost getting a quad kill, really good repeeking and not chasing the player out blue container very nice patience, if only you were slightly slower on the 4th flick you would have gotten him for sure. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good early molly B, nice jiggling like the way I recommended, when on B and your teammates are fighting middle don’t look anywhere but tunnels if you see red dots then maybe after you made sure no-one is tunnel, good kill tunnels, nice flash up short blinding the enemy holding you but it could have been dangerous if he was closer and good kill on the guy site a little bit of a messy spray but overall pretty good. W</li>
                    <li>Ak buy, I don’t recommend holding the headshot angle from short against the players on site as they get a huge advantage. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, I recommend holding and trying to shoot through any crossing gap as it is a relatively safe play and can net you a ton of damage done and free kills, unfortunate peek on the guy crossing wasn’t completely focused. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, in a 2v4 situation I would recommend  asking your teammate to immediately save and play for exits although you performed quite well, you just did not have enough time to clear all the neccesary angles and get the kills. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, I like that you are using the way I recommend crossing, I don’t recommend playing near CT as the enemies on site can see your feet and spam you, when playing against an awp player, go for information before the engagment you do not want to peek onto an awper as they have the advantage. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle armour, Sick kill through smoke and car for the headshot and solid 1v1 clutch for the win. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Super late take long when retaking long super late in the round I recommend keeping your gun out the whole time this prevents any chance of you getting caught off-guard without a weapon, good use of my off-angle long to secure the kill although immediatly after the kill you were very quick to leave the angle which could have been dnagerous as the last 2 were not yet confirmed, good kill on the enemy peeking CT and solid kill on the enemy Car on B to get the trade on your teammate. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, when changing positions always look at where the enemy can come from and not where you are going this will lead to you dying less from enemies getting a timing on you and allows you to fight back. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, no-action. W</li>
                    <li>T Pistol armour, B rush, good trade on your teammate lowers, solid triple kill but early reloading when not in cover nearly got you killed twice that round and did get you killed stopping you from getting the quad, but overall pretty good. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle armour, unfortunate timing and push up to B left you open to the enemy elevator, I recommend crossing to truck and quickly making your way up to window if CT smoke is not down. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good use of sound to allow you to predict the enemy peek, solid spray control to get the enemy ferrari peeking you, unfortunate peek short. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10, rush B, good utility usage, smoking door and using the good flash blinding the enemy platform for a while but unfortunate pathing led to you dying after the enemy got unblinded. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good A flash but your peek wasn’t executed properly it felt like you almost accidentally moved into the angle instead of a full focus, proper crosshair placement peek. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10, after teammate died with Ak, I would have recommended upgrading as it was quite a safe play in order to get a significant upgrade, when you smoked the cross you did it as you were crossing which could have led to you dying, I recommend dropping the smoke first and then crossing, solid after plant positioning, and nice kill on the defuser unfortunatley due to your weaker weponry you were not able to finish off the second kill as the damage of the mac-10 was too weak. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, accidentally ignored the callouts of a teammate to the enemies position which led to you dying from them. L</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, good movement up long to get into a nice angle but I don’t recommend holding short from car when you don’t have to worry about long as car is completely wallbangable which leads to a false sence of cover instead I recommend sitting near the wall long (Only when you know for sure no-one is coming long). W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, solid trade kill on the enemy middle and nice kill on the enemy peeking long to secure the second unfortunately unable to secure the third kill because they had the advantage in the close range engagment leading to you missing 1 shot and dying. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good pathing into middle to secure kill middle, unfortunately your positioning goose led to you dying from an enemy pushing long. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Your teammates taking early fights putting you at a disadvantage but ultimately leaving you in a 1v1 situation, which you win by playing the time very well done! good round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, bad flash and understanding of where the enemy killed your teammate from left your crosshair placement off and made all the fights you took uncomfortable I know you were flashed but after that it still was slightly off and then accidentally flashing yourself, this positioning was terrible on your teammates part I would have recommended trying to “Gather the troops” in a 5v3 situation the only way they can win is if you are spread out like you were getting into 1v1’s and they forced it into a 3v3 situaiton for a second which was scary but fortuantely things got handled. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Bad fight W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good work from teamamtes putting you guys in a big advantage but you should just work togeather and go togeather, solid kill on the enemy platform. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, no-action W</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>How to play “Simple CS”: Rules of CSGO</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Be prepared for anything,  (random pushes through smokes, random peeks) and play accordingly hold angles with focus even if you are sure no one will peek.</li>
                    <li>Don’t have “lazy” crosshair placement make sure your crosshair is always honed on the next most likely position for the enemy to peek even when rotating only remove your crosshair from the position when you are sure you are safe.</li>
                    <li>Don’t reload your weapon unnecessarily, unless you are completely safe from the enemy and know they won’t hear you as the act of reloading can cause some enemies to play agro trying to catch you off-guard.</li>
                    <li>Don’t pull out your knife or grenade if there is any chance of the enemy peeking you at all, guns will always do more damage than grenades more consistently and don’t leave you vulnerable for ~ 3 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Cover positions your teammates are not, always be looking for gaps in your defences or possible flanks from the enemies.</li>
                    <li>Always buy as a team, don’t go against the buy of the team, and buy hero guns consistently as this will put your team at a huge disadvantage when they can buy and you can’t.</li>
                    <li>Don’t give away your side's advantage for free (Don’t give away your position as a CT, like running or making noise or throwing random utility / Don’t downgrade from an AK to a M4 during a round and try not to peek predictably)</li>
                    <li>Peek angles individually while practising proper pre-aiming and crosshair placement and don’t overexpose yourself to multiple angles, unless you are rushing in this case you have to move fast and there is a purpose behind your peek.</li>
                    <li>In any situation when you might encounter an enemy, try to make sure you have a teammate to trade you as this will immediately improve your odds of winning any fight you take, as you usually peek more confidently as you are not afraid of dying and confidence is crucial in gunfights and even if you die, your teammate should be able to kill the person who killed you.</li>
                    <li>Learn how to trade and do it constantly, trading is one of the most important skills you can learn and master as it will significantly improve the chances of you winning games and getting impactful kills.</li>
                    <li>After every kill change positions, this is for both CT and T side as this allows you to keep the positional advantage and constantly catch the enemy off-guard which increases your chances of winning the next fight.</li>
                    <li>Use sound to your advantage, listen to everything from: where gunshots are coming from (learn to recognise decoys just by their sound) / Listen for footsteps and understand how far away from you people can hear your footsteps (Radar zoom 0.85 gives you an idea of distance you can be hear while running or can hear enemies)</li>
                    <li>Use a mixture of preemptive and reactive utility throughout the game (Before seeing the enemy and after seeing the enemy, if you favor 1 too heavily the enemy can notice this and take advantage by either rushing if you are reactive or slowing down and waiting if you are preemptive)</li>
                    <li>Learn to Study your opponents and try doing it subconsciously look for things like (Weaker players / Weaponry choices (Awp? Shotgun?) / Economic decisions (Are they saving often? do they have a lot of weak buys?) / Positioning decisions (Most players sit in the same 3-5 spots on each site) / Play decisions (Agro / passive) / Utility choices(preemptive/reactive))</li>
                    <li>Do not be hungry for kills this can lead to you overextending and dying early or potentially throwing away rounds you should win, also although getting an ace is nice focus on winning the game over looking good, this will put you in good stead for your career and do not harbour any resentment for anyone that you think has “stolen” your ace or clip.</li>
                    <li>Use timing && movement to your advantage whenever possible, this will allow you to get into positions the enemy might think are not possible and give you the advantage in any fight you take, although pulling out a knife to make a jump during a gunfight is not advisable, preferably do any movements or positional changes significantly before enemies are spotted and before they can hear you.</li>
                    <li>Once in a position do not change or throw away your position advantage for a marginally better position instead focus on the gunfights that are about to endure, by simply focusing on the fights this will put you at a larger advantage than the positional change and losing the element of surprise.</li>
                    <li>Whenever possible play as a team, “Ape together strong”, now doing individual plays are acceptable but should never be the norm otherwise they become predictable and easy to counter and then just put your team at a disadvantage.</li>
                    <li>Do not bait in an attempt to make yourself look good or get a highlight, you should be able to use and help your teammates at the same time, if you are able to get 2 kills and keep your teammate alive, that is significantly better than getting 3 kills and letting your teammate die.</li>
                    <li>Never blame your teammates, if the only person you can blame is yourself then you look a lot more deeply into your game rather than passing the blame onto someone else and refusing to accept that you had some part to play in the loss, never make excuses like “I did my job” or “I dropped 28 kills so its not my fault” because in the grand scheme of the game these things do not matter and when you look deeply into your own game, you improve significantly quicker, than someone who does not accept blame.</li>
                    <li>Toxicity kills teamwork/communication and coordination, which is one of the quickest ways to lose a match and shut down mentally, never start toxicity as it is unnecessary in all situations (Remember you are playing a game there is no need to be nasty), and if someone else is being toxic judge their ability to communicate and coordinate with the team although there will be outbursts does the information he provides and the ability to guide him out-weigh his toxicity? if not mute him but still drop to him whenever possible and give callouts just because you have him muted doesn’t mean he has you muted.</li>
                    <li>When communicating make sure to state the following info as concisely and as quickly as possible: Number / Tagged / Position / Weapon
                        for example “One tagged 60 back platform B, with awp” | “Two pushing long house with pistols” | “One dead short had AK” | “Three Rushing long, one tagged 60, they had AKs”
                        If no damage is done you can drop the tagged portion and if dead no real need to state weapon
                        Note if info is older than 30 seconds disregard it except weapon type and damage dealt as this could be useful if asked for.</li>
