                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, solid long rush and good moving as a pack, when everyone is looking at one spot like short you must try to realize where you are open from, in this situation no-one realized the enemy flanking long which nearly won a 1v4 situation. W</li>
                    <li>Galil buy, Good cover and solid trade for your teammates killing the guy lowers,Bad flash blinding teammates and yourself as you came out B, also crosshair placement was a bit off as you were moving around on the B site overall solid round. W</li>
                    <li>Galil buy, when playing a 3v1 situation you should really try to get all your teammates to come with you wherever you go as the only way the enemy can win is by catching you guys 1 by 1, also when you have the bomb always play super far back short so even if the CT enemy kills you there is no chance of the bomb dropping CT. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good flashes long to get a flash assist kill, and solid reaction to the enemy pushing up middle a very quick kill, also good trade and solid kill on the enemy on site. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good flashes long again and solid flash assist, again when everyone is focused on the 1 angle it is your job to cover the potential flank which is long again which nearly wins them this 2v4 situation. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, I don’t recommend this random jumping as even though you are gaining information it takes 1.5 seconds for you to be accurate again after landing from a jump and this puts you at a significant disadvantage in any gun-fight you take, unfortunately, tried to cross CT with no CT smoke even though you had a smoke on your body. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good b smoke doors to allow your teammates to focus on just the enemies on sight, when blind you should focus getting to cover or hiding in this situation you were caught out in the open from the awper peeking window. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Unfortunately, got caught off-guard from the enemy rushing long, as your spray was tracking behind the enemy, I recommend listening for a long run and always being ready if they are on a low buy like they were. L</li>
                    <li>p250 no armour, unfortunate timing on looking away from lower tunnels. L</li>
                    <li>Deag armour, a good trade kill on the guy lowers, unfortunately, you were not expecting the push-uppers at the same time so you got caught off-guard. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good readiness for the guy pushing middle, but again you need to focus on holding the angles your teammates are not as this is the third time the enemy has flanked long and gotten a free kill nearly 2. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good focus on killing the guy long but it was a disadvantageous fight as you were facing off against an awp, I would have recommended sitting car instead of openly on Ramp as this would have given you cover from long and CT so you would have put yourself at a bit more of an advantage. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Solid hold against the enemy pushing lowers for an easy kill, good utility on B with the door smoke and a nice flash coming out tunnels, also a solid trade on your teammate killing the guy on site as well as getting the bomb down, solid overall round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good pathing onto B but you should have focused on getting the smoke down sooner as the awper by door and scout by window was causing alot of issues for your teammates exiting tunnels. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Unfortunately, you got caught off-guard by the enemy pushing middle although they have done this quite a few times in the past just unfortunate timing as you pulled out your knife. W</li>
                    <li>CT pistol, pistol armour, Nice spam through the smoke to get the kill on the enemy lowers. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, When crossing I don’t recommend jumping as this actually makes it easier for the enemy to get the kill/damage on you, while spraying you stepped but fortunately your spray hit his head which was nice. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, positioning when holding tunnels is extremely open with no cover just kind of standing out in the open, unfortunately, you left B as your thought the enemy was short even though your teammate had already killed the one short player and the enemy pushed out onto B. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Solid double kill although going up elevator was executed poorly as you had many opportunities to die, I will show you the optimal pathing, although good job not dying to the enemy on site and getting the kill on the one long as well as the last enemy hiding on site. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good B positioning and solid B utility, although unfortunate movement caused you to die. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you during that game, positions you wanted/comfortable in real life/engagements you took? <br>Bit uncomfortable, pressured from streaming to coaching, felt unimpactful during the game, T side felt particularly bad, CT side a bit better </li>

                <h3>Focus areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crouch less and only use it when necessary such as movement or when it gives you an advantage in an angle.</li>
                    <li>Focus on holding angles your teammates are not to prevent any chance of flanks</li>
                    <li>Don’t randomly jump OR pull out utility when there is a possibility of you getting shot or seeing an enemy</li>
                    <li>Focus on improving crosshair placement</li>
                    <li>Focus on improving Rifle spray control</li>
